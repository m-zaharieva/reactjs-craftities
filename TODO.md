[ ] - To refactor the persistanse of the data from function, to hook, as Ivo showed us Authentication Workshop. May be the items, saved to localstorage, should be an user object, where accesstoken is part of. And on page load to check if there is an user object and after that, to check if the token is expired. The idea is the header to be changed before loading the page, if there is a token, but it is expired.
